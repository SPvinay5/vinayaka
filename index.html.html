As a friend i would like to say some important things to you<br>
1) Focus on your work but "don't expect results."<br>
2) helping below people "without expecting anything in return."<br>
3) Balancing is important in every way in life<br>
4) listen to heart.<br>
5) mind should be in control or else I will be very very disappointed.<br>
6) think positive not negative<br>
7) there should be trust in life because ನಂಬಿಕೆ ನೆ ದೇವ್ರು.<br>
8) In life we should not ಜಸ್ತಿ ಅನುಮಾನ ಪಡಬಾರ್ದು.<br>
9) With keeping negativity in mind we can't achieve anything really anything in life.<br>
10) respecting everyone equally.<br>
11) we should love the work what we do.<br></p> <br>
    <p>Just call me awesome Dude.</p>
